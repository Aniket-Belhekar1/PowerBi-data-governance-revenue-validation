Problem:
- Different dashboards reported different revenue figures.

Root Cause:
- Lack of standardized revenue definition and inconsistent use of raw sales data.

Impact:
- Revenue overstated by ~22% (₹6.49L), varying by category and month.

Resolution:
- Implemented certified revenue definitions, governed data layers, and controlled semantic measures.

Prevention:
- Built a validation dashboard to continuously detect and explain metric drift.
